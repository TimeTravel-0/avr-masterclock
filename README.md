avr-masterclock
===============

makefile is based on makefile generated by http://www.sax.de/~joerg/mfile/ , setup script for debian included.

additional packages: gcc-avr, avr-libc

with STK500 and attiny2313:

make program
make upload-fuses


if you want to program / test the AVR on STK500 with 32kHz, you have to configure STK500 via avrdude terminal mode:

avrdude -c stk500 -p t2313 -F -t

avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

avrdude done.  Thank you.
